This is project 9 on the OpenClassrooms iOS Developer course

You go to a startup conference and meet Angie. She is working on her ‘smart-market’ idea to market various products to movie lovers. Angie has already secured an initial investment using a prototype she's quickly put together. She’s now looking for an iOS developer who can help her company implement a ‘beta’ version of the app that will have a nice appearance and will also demonstrate core functionality. She thinks that you may be a good fit for her team and wonders if you’d be interested in taking it on. You love movies (that’s for sure!) so why not?!
App requirements

The app will display lists of movies available to watch on Netflix for various categories, and show the 'Latest’ section by default. (Suggested API: Apple itunes, you are also welcome to use any other public API according to your preference)

A user can bookmark a movie to form their personal selection, mark it as "watched", and add a note.

A user can view the bookmarked list and the list of "watched" movies.

While a user is viewing a movie category listing or details of a particular movie, they are presented with related products that may interest them*.

If anything gets a user’s attention, they are redirected to the purchasing resource.

*In context of this project you will also simulate an ad resource. Create a selection of ads of your choosing and randomly present one in the related app views.
